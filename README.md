# Simple-Roots-Plot

# Overview:
In this question we will plot a mathematical function using Matplotlib, and then identify 
and plot the roots of the function by using the bisection method.

# Instructions:
First, plot the function f(x) = cosh (x) + cos (x) - 150 over the interval -10, 10] using 
Matplotlib. You should plot at least 1,000 points so that the curve is smooth. The line color 
should be black, and it should have a label to show its equation.

Then, plot a line for the x-axis and a line for the y-axis. The lines should extend to the 
boundaries of the plot window. The lines should use the dashed line style and have the color grey.

Finally, use the bisection method to determine the roots of the equation in the interval (-10, 101, 
and plot them in red with the label 'Roots.? Recall that the bisection method must be given an 
initial interval in which to find a root, and only returns one root at a time. (You must visually 
inspect the graph to determine the intervals.)

After plotting, show the graph to the screen. Make sure to include a legend so that your labels 
show up as well. Your final graph should look like the above image.
